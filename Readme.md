## Overview

gostache is an implementation of the mustache template language in Go. It is better suited for website templates than Go's native pkg/template. gostache is fast -- it parses templates efficiently and stores them in a tree-like structure which allows for fast execution. 

For more information about mustache, check out the [mustache project page] ( http://github.com/defunkt/mustache ).
